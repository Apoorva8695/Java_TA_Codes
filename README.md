# Introduction to Java


This repo will contain all the code snippets and links that we use during the class. This README will be continually updated with new stuff. Be sure to watch the repo to get the updates. On to the good stuff.

### Installation
* ```sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk``` for people on \*nix systems.
* [Java 8 on Mac](https://gist.github.com/JeOam/a926dbb5145c4d0789c1)
* [Java 8 on Windows](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java8/java8_environment.htm)

Try ```java -version```  on the command-line. It should show something similar to this:
```
java version "1.8.0_102"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_102-b14)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.102-b14, mixed mode)
```
Make sure it says 1.8.x. and you're good to go. 

### Getting started with Git & Github
