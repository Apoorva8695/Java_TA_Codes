# Introduction to Java

This repo will contain all the code snippets and links that we use during the class. This README will be continually updated with new stuff. Be sure to watch the repo to get the updates. On to the good stuff.

### Installation
* ```sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk``` for people on \*nix systems.
* [Java 8 on Mac](https://gist.github.com/JeOam/a926dbb5145c4d0789c1)
* [Java 8 on Windows](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java8/java8_environment.htm)

Try ```java -version```  on the command-line. It should show something similar to this:
```
java version "1.8.0_102"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_102-b14)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.102-b14, mixed mode)
```
Make sure it says 1.8.x. and you're good to go. 

### Getting started with Git & Github


* [Setting up git for Github](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
* [Github hello-world](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
* [An interactive git tutorial](https://github.com/jlord/git-it)

Create a Github user account and commit all your code to Github. It will help you in the future. 

### A bit of history

* [A short history of Java](https://dzone.com/articles/a-short-history-of-java)
* [Java & Cafe Babe](https://dzone.com/articles/the-magic-word-in-java-cafebabe)

### Places to get help

* [Oracle Java Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) - Go through the tutorial atelast once. They provide an overview of almost all the features of Java with appropirate examples and motivation behind the design decisions. 
* [Oracle Java Docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/) - This is where you'll spend a large amount of your time. Get used to reading the Java Docs. 

### If you want to get into the gory internals

* [Java Language specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/index.html) - Though a bit pedantic and boring at times, this is the place to start (or atleast skim through) if you want to get into the Java internals.
* [JVM Specification](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/index.html) - The JVM specs give you an insight into the inner workings of the JVM. The guide lays down rules and behaviors that JVM implementations are supposed to conform to. Read the specs first before getting into the JVM code. Contains a very readable, high-level overview of how the Java GC works.

### Where to get the code

Java is an exteremly verbose and readable langugage. If you ever feel like looking at the code that makes all the magic happen, head over to [GrepCode/JVM](http://grepcode.com/project/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/) to read the code.


### Coding convention

[Here](http://javaranch.com/style.jsp) are some accepted practices and conventions to follow when coding in Java.
